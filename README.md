# Instagram Automation Bot

I have made an Instagram Automation Bot using Python which can do auto follow-unfollow followers, do likes, comments and other operations on Instagram.

# Softwares Used:

1> Mozilla Firefox Browser

2> Windows PowerShell

3> Any code editor of your choice(Sublime, VSCode, Pycharm, Notepad etc..)

4> Instagram Automation Tool(InstaPy)

# Steps

1> Download the InstPy Automation Tool by writing the command "pip install InstaPy" in the Windows PowerShell.

2> After the download is over, write the following source code(written in Python) in the code editor of your choice and save the following source code with .py extension.

3> After saving the source code, write the following command "py <filename.py>" in the Windows PowerShell to execute the source code.

# Output
The Instagram Bot will automatically open the account with the credentials that is provided and it will do the following operations. For reference, see the sample ouput file in this repository.
